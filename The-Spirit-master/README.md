**The Spirit** is a WebGL experience by Edan Kwan. It uses the noise derivatives and curl noise to create that smoky look and feel. It also uses the **[the new particles](http://www.simppa.fi/blog/the-new-particle/)** which invented by Simo Santavirta [@simppafi](https://twitter.com/simppafi)

This experiment is also inspired by [David Li](http://david.li/)'s [Flow](http://david.li/flow/) experiment.
